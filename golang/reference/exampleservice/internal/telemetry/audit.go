// Audit logging implements golang/operations/security.md ### Audit Logging:
// audit logs answer "who did what, to what, when, and with what result" for
// security- and compliance-relevant actions. They are DISTINCT from the
// operational/access logs that telemetry.NewLogger produces: this logger has its
// OWN handler and sink so audit evidence can carry its own retention, access
// controls, and integrity guarantees, and is never sampled or rotated with the
// access log.
//
// The schema is fixed and low-cardinality. Records carry the full who/what/
// when/where on every entry and NEVER carry secrets or PII payloads — the fact
// and identity of an action (actor, action, resource id, result), not its
// sensitive contents.

// AuditResult is the low-cardinality outcome of an audited action. A denial or
// failure is as important to record as a success, so the set is closed and
// explicit rather than a free-form string.
type AuditResult string

const (
	// AuditSuccess marks an allowed, completed action (e.g. a created widget).
	AuditSuccess AuditResult = "success"
	// AuditFailure marks an authentication failure: the caller could not be
	// established (missing or invalid credential).
	AuditFailure AuditResult = "failure"
	// AuditDenied marks an authorization denial: the caller is known but lacks the
	// required role or ownership for the action.
	AuditDenied AuditResult = "denied"
)

// AuditEvent is one audit record. Every field is non-sensitive identity or
// metadata: Actor/Tenant identify WHO, Action/Resource identify WHAT, Result is
// the outcome, Time is WHEN (UTC), and RequestID is WHERE (the correlation id).
// No token, header, body, or other payload is ever placed on this struct.
type AuditEvent struct {
	// Actor is the principal subject ("sub"). Empty for an authentication failure
	// where no principal was established.
	Actor string
	// Tenant is the principal's tenant/org. Empty when no principal is established.
	Tenant string
	// Action is the audited operation, e.g. "authenticate", "authorize",
	// "widget.create". Low-cardinality and stable.
	Action string
	// Resource is the target resource identifier (an id or route), never its
	// contents. Empty when the action has no specific target (e.g. an authn
	// failure before routing to a resource).
	Resource string
	// Result is the outcome: success, failure, or denied.
	Result AuditResult
	// RequestID is the correlation id tying the audit record to the access log and
	// trace for the same request.

// AuditLogger emits structured audit events to a dedicated sink. It wraps a
// private *slog.Logger so callers cannot reach the underlying handler and mix
// operational logs into the audit stream. Time is stamped from an injected
// clock (UTC) so records are deterministic in tests and consistent with
// foundations/time.md (no ambient wall-clock reads in reusable packages).

// audit sink — SEPARATE from the application logger's writer so audit evidence
// is governed independently. The handler is fixed to JSON at info level: audit
// records are evidence, not debug output, and are not level-filtered away. The
// clock stamps each record's UTC time.

// Emit writes one audit event. The record carries the fixed who/what/when/where

// slog handler serializes writes). It deliberately accepts only an AuditEvent so
// no caller can attach arbitrary (possibly sensitive) attributes to the stream.
